This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description
This is a test project for arbitrary community search, to experiment with NextJS and Prisma technology

The app allows you to search through list of communities stored on the database and check the basic information about them. 

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/communities](http://localhost:3000/api/communities). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/communities.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
